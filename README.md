## Why
We need to change our approach to CSS. 
This isn't a ruleset that you must follow 100% and salute before you go to bed but rather a guide to how we can make our CSS:
* Clearer code
* Easier maintenance
* Write less code
* Separation of markup and style
* Faster development
* Faster loading pages
